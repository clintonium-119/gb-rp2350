# Gameboy Emulator for the Pi Pico 2

This is a Gameboy emulator for the Pi Pico 2 completely written on Rust. The emulator is still a work in progress and optimizations are still being worked on but most games should be playable and accurate.

Supported Features:
* Save game support to SD Card.
* Loading games from SD Card or directly from flash.
* Running games bigger than the available memory of the Pi Pico.
* Sound support.
* Screen scaler, the image of the GB is scaled to fit on different screens sizes.
* PSRAM support for Pimoroni Pico Plus 2.
* Support for multiple displays from the mipidsi library (https://github.com/almindor/mipidsi/tree/master/mipidsi)
* Game rom selection menu.

Pending Features:
* Performance improvements.
* Gameboy color support.


# Hardware
## What you need
* (1x) [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://a.co/d/44gvGwD)

Notes: You can change the default mapping of the pins by setting `CUSTOM_PIN_MAP=my_custom_pin_map.env` setting.
Take a look at the `pin_mapping.env` file for a reference of all pin names.

# Installing the firmware
1. Install the latest stable version of Rust.
2. Then use `rustup` to grab the Rust Standard Library for the appropriate targets.
`rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf`
3. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico, then connect to your computer using a micro USB cable. Release BOOTSEL once the drive RPI-RP2 appears on your computer.
4. Set up the `.env` file to set the ROM and display configurations. Use `.env.example` as your reference.
5. Build the gameboy emulator using `cargo build --release`.
6. Convert the `elf` binaries into into `uf2`: `picotool uf2 convert .\target\thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf\release\gb-rp2350 -t elf gb-rp2350.uf2`
7. Drag and drop the UF2 file (`gb-rp2350.uf2`) on to the RPI-RP2 drive. The Raspberry Pi Pico will reboot and will now run the emulator.

# Rom Loading Modes
The emulator supports 3 different ways to load roms:
* "RAM": Rom is loaded at runtime from the root of the sd card. In "RAM" mode the Rom may not fully fit on RAM, chunks of the ROM are cached and loaded as needed, you can control the size of this cache with by changing "ROM_CACHE_SIZE", default = 10. RAM mode may have some stutter for roms that switch between banks too often.
* "FLASH": Load rom from SDCARD into the flash storage of the Pi Pico. The rom size is limited by the amount of flash available in the Pi Pico 2 (approx 3.5mb).
* "PSRAM": Load rom from SDCARD into PSRAM if it is available (Pimoroni Pico Plus 2).
 
Note: If you are using are using a Pimoroni Pico Plus 2 or other boards with 8mb+ PSRAM modules choose "PSRAM". Otherwise choose "FLASH" mode, the flash of the Pi Pico has a long but limited number of writes so it will at some point degrade your Pi Pico. If you need to run a game too big to fit on flash use the "RAM" mode.


 # Display drivers
 The emulator supports different displays thru the `mipidsi` library. To enable the settings for your display set the `DISPLAY_DRIVER` paramter from the environment variables files to point to the correct driver.
#### List of supported models
* GC9A01 = mipidsi::models::GC9A01
* ILI9341 = mipidsi::models::ILI9341Rgb565
* ILI9342C = mipidsi::models::ILI9342CRgb565
* ILI9486 = mipidsi::models::ILI9486Rgb565
* ST7735 = mipidsi::models::ST7735s
* ST7789 = mipidsi::models::ST7789
* ST7796 = mipidsi::models::ST7796

If the display is not under your required orientation you can change the `DISPLAY_ROTATION` and `DISPLAY_MIRRORED` to adjust to your setup.

# Preparing the SD card
The SD card is used to store game roms and save game progress. For this project, you will need a FAT 32 formatted Micro SD card with roms you legally own. Roms must have the .gb extension.

* Insert your SD card in a Windows computer and format it as FAT 32
* Copy your .gb file as `rom.gb` to the SD card root folder (subfolders are not supported at this time)
* Optionally copy the boot rom of the Gameboy into the root of the SD card as `dmg_boot.bin`. 
* Insert the SD card into the SD card slot.
